# HIPSTER
High-througput imaging platform for hydra and other small organisms




Suggested Materials:
  Image Acquisition and Enclosure:
  USB digital microscope (Dino-lite) or any camera
  Dino-lite Camera mount (or any custom camera mount)
  Makerbeam XL starter kit + Black foam core (3/16”) OR IKEA bookshelf with door inset

Lighting Module:
  RBG strip LEDs
  Teensey microcontroller
  5v power supply
  3000 tough Rolux diffuser (www.Rosco.com)
  Acrylic 3/16” (Custom enclosure for light module)

Image acquisition can be performed with any open source webcam software, such as ispy (www.ispy.com) which allows recording from multiple cameras simultaneously or custom matlab script with image acquisition toolbox.

Acrylic pieces are cut to construct a box to hold the 4x6” board of RGB LEDs and diffuser ~2” away from the LEDs. Teensey microcontrolller is used to programthe RGB LEDs (both intensity and color) with a custom script. LEDs require 5V power supply. The lighting module provides diffused illumination from the bottom of the device for high contrast image capture with sensor from above.

Makerbeam kit (extrusion beams) and foam core are used for making the enclosure for the imaging platform to isolate external lighting.
