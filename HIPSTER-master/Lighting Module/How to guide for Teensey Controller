HIPSTER â€“ Disco Lights
Materials:
RGB LEDs WS2812 (flickering issue)
Teensy 3.0 microcontrollers
Roscolux 3000 diffuser

Softwares:
Arduino Teensy compiler with custom script
_flashcolor:R,G,B_ ~ Set the color to flash.  0-255 values for R, G, and B
 _stimperiod:x.xx_ ~ Set the stimulation period.  Time is hours as floating point - 1.1 = 1 hour and 6 minutes
 _flashperiod:x.xx_ ~ Set the flash period.  Time is in seconds as floating point
 _pulseduration:x.xx_ ~ Set the stimulation pulse duration.  Time is in minutes as floating point
 _flash:X_ ~ Turn flashing on or off.  X is 0 or 1.  should begin or stop flashing immediately after command received.
flashcolor:0,0,255 
stimperiod:0.25
flashperiod:1
pulseduration:0.5
flash:1
Every 15minutes, pulse LEDs to Blue for 1 sec on 1 sec off (baseline) for 30 sec.

Set all LEDs to same value RGB range from 0-255 (0 = off, 255= highest intensity)	
setall:xxx,xxx,xxx
	set specific LED to a value 
		setone:x-xxx,xxx,xxx
		update
	Periodic Light stimulation:
	Start stimulation protocol
		flash:1 
	stop stimulation procotol
		flash:0
	set stimulation light color
		flashcolor:xxx,xxx,xxx
	set stimulation period (Time before repeating stimulation sequence). Time is hours. 1 = 1 hour, 0.25 = 15mins
stimperiod:0.25

set flash period (Time LED flash stays on for). Time is seconds. 1 = 1sec
flashperiod:1
set pulse duration (Time LEDs flash on/off sequence is repeated). Time is minutes. 0.5 = 30 seconds
pulseduration:0.5
	
TyCommander 
to interface with multiple Teensys and run different script on each.
