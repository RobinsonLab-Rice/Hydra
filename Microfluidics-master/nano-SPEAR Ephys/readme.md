## Device Overview
nano-SPEAR electrophysiology device is used to measure the electrical activity of the epithelial muscle cells (EMG-like recording). Hydra movement is confined with hour-glass shape chamber pinching hydra body column.

Photomasks notes:
We designed layouts with LEdit and obtain the glass photomasks from Frontrange. Because small feature sizes are used, ~10 um electrode traces, glass photomasks are required.

## Fabrication

    1. KMPR bottom layer (~40 um)- design for photoresist layer to make channels for animal immobilization
    2. Electrode layer (~200 nm) - design for the electrode traces
    3. KMPR top layerlayer (~80 um) - design for photoresist layer to make channels for animal immobilization
    4. Hydra flow layer (~100 um) - design for the microfluidic layer to insert the animal and keep immobilized
