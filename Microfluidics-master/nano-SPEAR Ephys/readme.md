nano-SPEAR electrophysiology device is used to measure the electrical activity of the epithelial muscle cells (EMG-like recording). 


Directories:

"Layouts (GDS)" contains .gds files with mask designs for fabricating nano-SPEAR chips.

    1. Electrode layer - design for the electrode traces
    2. KMPR layer - design for photoresist layer to make channels for animal immobilization
    3. Flow layer - design for the microfluidic layer to insert the animal and keep immobilized
