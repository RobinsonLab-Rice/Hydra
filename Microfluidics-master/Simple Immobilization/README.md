## Device Overview
Simple Immobilization device (~100um height) confine movement of hydra to quasi-2D for whole-animal imaging.

Photomasks notes:
We designed layouts with LEdit and obtain the transparency photomasks from CAD/ART services.

## Fabrication
### Microfluidic Master mold - Hydra layer

      1. Clean wafer
        Heat 4” Si wafer @250C for 5min
        Oxygen plasma clean: 5 min ~100W, 10Torr

      2. Spin SU8-2075 for ~100um thickness
        Step 1: 300rpm - 100rpm/s - 20s
        Step 2: 2100rpm - 300rpm/s - 30s
        
      3. Pre-Bake
        5 min @ 65C
        20 min @ 95C 
        
      4. Expose
        ~ 340 mJ/cm2 with UV filter
        Expsure dose may need to be adjusted depending on layout or lamp age
        
      5. Post-bake
        5 min @ 65C 
        12 min @ 95C
        
      6. Develop 
        5-8 minutes in SU-8 developer (if it takes too long replace with new developer)
        IPA rinse
        Air dry
        
      7. Hard Bake
        40 min @ 65C
        100C/hr ramp to 160C 30 mins
        Cool to RT slowly (if the subtrate is heated/cooled too fast, the photoresist may crack and peel off the device due to high thermal stress)
