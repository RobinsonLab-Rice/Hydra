- Types of devices

_Notes:_ 
- _This guide assumes access to and working knowledge of cleanroom equipments for soft-lithography (Mask aligner, plasma clearner, spinners, hot plate)._
- _We use transprency photomasks for the microfluidic devices (feature size/channel width >20 um)._
- _We use glass photomasks for nano-SPEAR ephys devices._



## Types of devices
- *Simple Immobilization:* Used for whole-brain imaging. Single layer immobilization chamber with ~100um height
- *nano-SPEAR ephys:* Used for measuring electrical activity from epithelial cells and whole-brain imaging. Tightest confinement
- *Behavioral Imaging Arena:* Used for non-interacting multiple whole-animal movement/behavior tracking. Hydra lanes are ~ 600um height with 'least' confinement.
- *Sensory Stimulation Devices:*
  - *Chemical Stimulation:* Used for whole-brain imaging while perfusing chemicals. Double layer photolithography for perfusion layer (~ 25 um height) and flow layer (~ 100um). Single layer PDMS with multiple height channels.
